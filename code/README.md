## Abstract

The code includes all functions necessary to run the results from the simulated data found in Section 3 of the paper. The file ‘Simulate data Code.R’ provides code to reporoduce the simulated data stored in the data folder. The ‘Model output code.R’ provides code to run the simulated data through the multiple models discussed in the paper and the ‘Model summary code.R’ takes the model output and summarized it concisely. Lastly, the tables.R and plots.R code provide code to recreate the tables and plots seen in the paper.
 


## Description
The following code files were used to obtain model output and summarize the output for the manuscript. 

Model Output Code.R
Model Summary Code.R
Tables.R
Plot.R




The HKC model sources a code file that is not publically avaibale called CodeSNW.R, which is not provided here due to being a code file provided by Su, C. L., Nešlehová, J. G., & Wang, W. (2019). Modelling hierarchical clustered censored data with the hierarchical Kendall copula. Canadian Journal of Statistics, 47(2), 182-203.  If one wishes to reporduce the model out from the HKC model, one should email Johanna G. Neslehova (johanna.neslehova@mcgill.ca) and ask for the apporpriate code.
